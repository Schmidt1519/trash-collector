Users sign up as either a customer or employee and manage their profile. Customers begin by entering their information and selecting a trash pickup day. They can change their pickup day at any time, add a one time pickup, or suspend their service. Their profile shows their current balance and all dates pertaining to pickup services.

Employees landing page shows all customers in their zip code that need a pickup on the current day. This includes regularly scheduled customers for that day of the week, one time pickups, and factors in suspended service dates. They can click on the customer to see their profile and see the address on a static map (Google Maps API). They can click a button to confirm a pickup and charge the customer.
